# Computer Network 💻
---
### ✅ 1. What is a Computer Network?

A **Computer Network** is when two or more computers are connected to share data, resources, or communication.

> 📦 Real Life Example: WhatsApp and Instagram work because millions of devices (phones, servers) are connected via networks.

**Benefits of Networking:**

- File sharing
    
- Internet access
    
- Communication (chat, email)
    
- Resource sharing (printers, servers)

# 🌐 Day 1: OSI Model – The Backbone of Networking

### 🤔 What is the OSI Model?

OSI stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**.

It's a **conceptual framework** that shows how data travels from one computer to another over a network. It divides the process into **7 layers**, each with a specific role.

---
### 🧱 7 Layers of the OSI Model (Top to Bottom)

| Layer | Layer Name   | What It Does (Simple)                                   | Example                 |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 7     | Application  | Interface for the user                                  | WhatsApp, Gmail         |
| 6     | Presentation | Converts data formats (encrypt, compress)               | JPEG ↔ PNG, Encryption  |
| 5     | Session      | Manages sessions (start, end communication)             | Logging in to a server  |
| 4     | Transport    | Ensures reliable delivery (TCP/UDP)                     | Splits data into chunks |
| 3     | Network      | Routes data using IP addresses                          | Google.com → IP         |
| 2     | Data Link    | Transfers frames between two directly connected devices | MAC Address             |
| 1     | Physical     | Actual hardware and transmission (cables, signals)      | Ethernet cable, Wi-Fi   |

---
### 📦 Real-Life Analogy: Sending a Parcel

Imagine sending a parcel:

1. **Application** – You write the letter.
    
2. **Presentation** – You translate it (e.g., Hindi to English).
    
3. **Session** – You call the post office to schedule pickup.
    
4. **Transport** – They pack and label it.
    
5. **Network** – They choose the best route (road, air).
    
6. **Data Link** – Truck loads it and drives it locally.
    
7. **Physical** – The wheels move the parcel physically.

---
### 💡 Remember Like This (Mnemonic):

> "**All People Seem To Need Data Processing**"  
> (A = Application, P = Presentation, S = Session, T = Transport, N = Network, D = Data Link, P = Physical)

# 🌐 Daily CN Lesson – **Day 2: TCP/IP Model**

> 📦 The real-world version of the OSI model, used by the internet today.

---
## 📘 What is the TCP/IP Model?

TCP/IP stands for **Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol**.

It is the **practical model** that the internet and most modern networks use to communicate. While the OSI model is a reference framework, **TCP/IP is the actual implementation**.

---
## 🧱 Layers of the TCP/IP Model (4 Layers Only!)

| Layer                 | OSI Equivalent | Role (Simple)                     | Example         |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **4. Application**    | OSI Layer 5–7  | Provides services to user         | HTTP, FTP, SMTP |
| **3. Transport**      | OSI Layer 4    | Ensures reliable or fast delivery | TCP, UDP        |
| **2. Internet**       | OSI Layer 3    | Handles addressing & routing      | IP, ICMP        |
| **1. Network Access** | OSI Layer 1–2  | Sends bits physically             | Ethernet, Wi-Fi |

---

### 🧠 Key Differences: OSI vs TCP/IP

|Feature|OSI Model|TCP/IP Model|
|---|---|---|
|Layers|7|4|
|Use|Conceptual|Practical (used in real world)|
|Developed By|ISO|DARPA (U.S. Dept. of Defense)|
|Popularity|Learning/Exams|Real-world Networking|

---

### 📦 Real-Life Analogy:

Let’s say you want to send a message using WhatsApp:

1. **Application Layer** → You type the message.
    
2. **Transport Layer** → The message is broken into packets.
    
3. **Internet Layer** → The address of the destination is added.
    
4. **Network Access Layer** → Message physically sent via Wi-Fi.

---

### 📌 Common Protocols in TCP/IP

| Layer          | Protocols                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Application    | HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS |
| Transport      | TCP, UDP                    |
| Internet       | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP       |
| Network Access | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP        |

# 🌐 **Daily CN Lesson – Day 3: IP Addressing + Subnetting Basics**

---
## 🧠 What is an IP Address?

An **IP (Internet Protocol) address** is a **unique identifier** for every device on a network — like a phone number for your computer.

It helps:

- **Identify** a device on the internet or network
    
- **Send and receive** data to/from the right place
---
## 📦 Types of IP Addresses

|Type|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**IPv4**|32-bit address, widely used|`192.168.1.1`|
|**IPv6**|128-bit address, newer, more space|`2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`|

---
### 📌 IPv4 Format

- 32 bits (divided into 4 sections or _octets_)
    
- Written in **dotted decimal** form: `192.168.0.1`
    
- Each section (octet) ranges from **0 to 255**
    

🔢 Example:  
`11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001` = `192.168.0.1`

---
## 🏠 Public vs Private IP Addresses

|Type|Used Where?|Example|
|---|---|---|
|**Private**|Inside home or office network|`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x`|
|**Public**|Globally on the internet|Your mobile/ISP-assigned IP|

🔒 Private IPs can’t be accessed directly from outside the network.

---
## 🧮 What is Subnetting?

**Subnetting** = Breaking a large network into smaller **sub-networks (subnets)**.

Why?

- Helps in **efficient IP allocation**
    
- **Improves performance** and **security**
    
- Reduces **broadcast traffic**

---

### 🧠 Subnet Mask

A **subnet mask** defines which part of the IP address is the **network** and which part is the **host**.

Common example:

- IP: `192.168.1.10`
    
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`
    

That means:

- `192.168.1` = Network part
    
- `.10` = Host (device) part

---
### 🎯 CIDR Notation

Instead of writing the whole mask:

- `192.168.1.10/24` → Means **first 24 bits** are for the network.
---
# 🌐 **Daily CN Lesson – Day 4: IP Address Classes + Default Subnets + Practice**
---
## 🧠 Why IP Address Classes?

Back in early networking days, the internet needed a way to organize IP addresses for different **sizes of networks**. That’s how **IP Classes** were introduced.

IPv4 addresses are divided into **5 classes** based on their **starting bits and range**.

---
## 📊 IP Address Classes (A to E)

|Class|Starting Bit(s)|Range (1st Octet)|Default Subnet Mask|Use|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**A**|0xxxxxxx|1 – 126|255.0.0.0 (/8)|Large networks|
|**B**|10xxxxxx|128 – 191|255.255.0.0 (/16)|Medium networks|
|**C**|110xxxxx|192 – 223|255.255.255.0 (/24)|Small networks|
|**D**|1110xxxx|224 – 239|N/A|Multicast|
|**E**|1111xxxx|240 – 255|N/A|Research only (Experimental)|

> Note: `127.x.x.x` is reserved for **loopback (localhost)**

---

## 🎯 Default Subnet Masks

|Class|Subnet Mask|CIDR Notation|Usable Hosts|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|255.0.0.0|`/8`|~16 million|
|B|255.255.0.0|`/16`|~65,000|
|C|255.255.255.0|`/24`|254|

> Usable hosts = 2ⁿ - 2  
> (`n` = number of host bits)

---
# 🌐 **Day 5: Static vs Dynamic IP + DHCP + DNS + Real-World Workflow**
---
## 🔁 **1. Static vs Dynamic IP**

|Type|Description|Example Use Case|
|---|---|---|
|**Static IP**|Manually assigned IP that never changes|Servers, printers|
|**Dynamic IP**|Automatically assigned by DHCP|Home Wi-Fi, mobile data|

---
### 🧠 Key Differences

|Feature|Static IP|Dynamic IP|
|---|---|---|
|Assigned by|Admin manually|DHCP server automatically|
|Changes?|Never (unless manually changed)|Yes, can change any time|
|Cost|Usually paid|Free|
|Example|`192.168.1.10`|`192.168.1.100` (changes)|

> ⚠️ If you're hosting a website or game server, **static IP** is better.

---
## ⚙️ **2. What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)?**

**DHCP** automatically assigns:

- **IP address**
    
- **Subnet mask**
    
- **Gateway**
    
- **DNS**
    

> 🧑‍💻 Without DHCP, every device must be configured **manually**.

---
### 🧭 DHCP Workflow (Real World Example):

1. **Device joins network**  
    (e.g., You connect your phone to Wi-Fi)
    
2. Device sends a **DHCPDISCOVER**
    
3. DHCP server replies with **DHCPOFFER**
    
4. Device sends **DHCPREQUEST**
    
5. Server confirms with **DHCPACK**
    

✅ Your phone now has an IP and can access the internet!

---
## 🌍 **3. What is DNS (Domain Name System)?**

DNS = Phonebook of the internet

It **converts domain names to IP addresses**.

> 📦 Example:  
> You type `www.google.com` → DNS says: "Its IP is `142.250.195.36`" → Browser connects to that server

---
### 🔗 DNS Resolution Flow (Simplified)

1. You type `www.example.com`
    
2. Your device asks a **DNS Resolver**
    
3. Resolver checks:
    
    - Local Cache
        
    - Root Server → TLD Server → Authoritative Server
        
4. Gets IP address → sends it to your browser
    
5. Browser connects to server via IP
---
## 🔁 Real-Life Network Flow Summary

```bash
You → Connect to Wi-Fi
→ DHCP assigns IP, DNS
→ You open google.com
→ DNS translates domain to IP
→ Browser connects via IP
→ Server sends response
→ You see Google homepage
```

# 🌐 **Day 6: Core Protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, ICMP, ARP) Explained with Real Examples**
---
## 🚦 Why Protocols?

A **protocol** is a set of rules that decide **how data is transferred** over a network. Just like people need a common language to communicate, devices need protocols.

Type of protocols:
- TCP
    
- UDP
    
- HTTP
    
- FTP
    
- ICMP
    
- ARP
---
## 1️⃣ **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

- 💬 TCP is **like a phone call** – both sides connect, talk in order, and confirm delivery.
    
- 🔄 It uses:
    
    - **Three-Way Handshake** (SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK)
        
    - **Sequencing** (arrange data chunks)
        
    - **Acknowledgement** (confirm delivery)
        
    - **Retransmission** (if data is lost)
    
- **Key Port**: Depends on the application (e.g., HTTP uses TCP port 80)

| Feature     | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type        | **Connection-oriented**                                 |
| Reliability | Guarantees **data delivery, order, and error checking** |
| Use Cases   | Web (HTTP), Email, File Transfers                       |
🧠 **Real Example:**

> When you open Gmail in a browser, the page must load completely and correctly — TCP ensures that every bit of data arrives in the correct order.

---
## 2️⃣ **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**

- 🚀 UDP is **like sending a letter** – no confirmation if it arrived.
    
- Fast, lightweight, but doesn’t guarantee:
    
    - Delivery
        
    - Order
        
    - Duplicate protection
    
- **Key Port**: Varies (e.g., DNS uses UDP port 53)

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Type|**Connectionless**|
|Reliability|No guarantee of delivery or order|
|Use Cases|Video streaming, VoIP, Gaming|

🧠 **Real Example:**

> When you watch a YouTube video or play PUBG, missing one data packet doesn’t matter — speed is more important than reliability.

---
## 3️⃣ **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

- 📄 Protocol used to **send webpages, images, text, etc.**
    
- Based on **TCP**
    
- **Stateless**: Every request is independent
    
- **Secure version**: HTTPS (adds encryption via SSL/TLS)

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Used for|Browsing websites (text, images, HTML)|
|Port|80 (unencrypted), 443 (HTTPS – encrypted)|
|Protocol Type|Application Layer|

🧠 **Real Example:**

> Typing `www.google.com` and seeing the homepage — HTTP handles this text/image transfer from server to your browser.

---
## 4️⃣ **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

- Used to **upload or download files** between client and server
    
- Two modes:
    
    - **Active mode** (client opens port, server connects back)
        
    - **Passive mode** (server opens a port, client connects)
        

**Requires login**: via username/password or anonymously

**Ports**: 20 (data) and 21 (command)

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Used for|Uploading/downloading files|
|Port|20, 21|
|Login|Requires username/password (sometimes anonymous)|

🧠 **Real Example:**

> Developers uploading code to a server, or downloading data from a remote site — FTP is commonly used here.

---
## 5️⃣ **ICMP – Internet Control Message Protocol**

- 📢 Used for sending **network status messages**, **not data**
    
- Used in diagnostic tools:
    
    - `ping` → Tests reachability
        
    - `traceroute` → Shows path to a destination
        

**Key Idea**: ICMP reports issues (like “host unreachable” or “TTL expired”)

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Purpose|Sends **control/error messages** (e.g., unreachable host)|
|Used by|`ping`, `traceroute`|
|Type|Network Layer

🧠 **Real Example:**

> When you use the `ping` command to test if a server is up, ICMP sends the echo request and receives the reply.

---
## 6️⃣ **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**

- 🧭 Helps your system **find the MAC address** of another device using its IP.
    
- Used within **LANs** (Local Area Networks)
    
- Maintains an **ARP table** to store resolved MACs
    

Example:

> Laptop wants to send data to `192.168.0.20`  
> → It checks ARP table  
> → If not found, it broadcasts: "Who has 192.168.0.20?"  
> → The device replies with its MAC address  
> → Now the laptop can send Ethernet frame directly

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Purpose|Maps **IP address to MAC address**|
|Works at|Data Link Layer|
|Role|Helps local delivery of packets within LAN|

🧠 **Real Example:**

> When your laptop sends a packet to your printer (on the same network), it uses ARP to find the printer’s MAC address first.
